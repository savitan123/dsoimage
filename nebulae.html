Cataloged as IC 5146, this beautiful object, nestled within a dense star field, is a combination of an emission nebula and an open star cluster. It is located approximately 4,000 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus.
The nebula has a visual magnitude of about 7.2 and an apparent diameter of 12 arcminutes, which corresponds to a physical diameter of about 15 light-years.
True to its nature as a stellar nursery, the Cocoon Nebula features a red emission cloud, a blue reflection nebula, and a dark absorption nebula (the dark lane leading into the cluster). Within the nebula, a 'new' star cluster is forming. The massive primary star at its center, born only about 100,000 years ago—a mere infant in cosmic terms—is responsible for ionizing the hydrogen gas (the red emission) and illuminating the surrounding dust (the blue reflection).
This image was captured in two parts. The first part consisted of Narrowband (H$\alpha$) imaging with a total integration of 11.5 hours from home. The second part involved Broadband (RGB) imaging with 4.1 hours of integration from the Golan Heights.

It is almost 2.5 degrees long on the sky and, because of its very low surface brightness, it is extremely difficult to observe visually.
It lies at a distance of about 1,000 light years from Earth. Its fluorescence is due to excitation of the H-beta line in the nebula by the nearby prodigiously energetic O7 star, Xi Persei.
The nebula was discovered by E. E. Barnard in 1884.

What do we see in this image besides thousands of suns?
At the bottom of the frame, resembling a mushroom cloud from an explosion, is the object IC 443, popularly known as the Jellyfish Nebula. It is a Galactic Supernova Remnant (SNR) located in the constellation Gemini. It is estimated that the supernova occurred approximately 30,000 years ago, an event that also gave birth to a neutron star.
Directly below the Jellyfish Nebula lies the star Propus. Propus (Eta Geminorum) is the primary component of a triple star system located about 700 light-years away. A red giant and the sixth-brightest star in Gemini, it marks the foot of Castor, one of the celestial twins.
In the upper part of the image, a bluish patch is visible—this is a reflection nebula. Surrounding and above it is a vast region of emission nebula (Hydrogen), interspersed with intricate dark nebulae.
To the left of the emission nebula sits another prominent star named Tejat (Mu Geminorum). This red giant is located roughly 230 light-years away. With an average apparent magnitude of 2.9, it is the fourth-brightest star in Gemini, following Pollux, Castor, and Alhena.
As a reminder, a red giant is a star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen in its core and begun the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell surrounding the core. These stars have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than the Sun. However, their outer envelope is lower in temperature, which gives them their characteristic yellowish-orange hue.
Technical Setup: The image was captured using a dual setup of Mono cameras with RGB and Ha (Hydrogen Alpha) filters. These were mounted on two RedCat 51 telescopes, sitting steadily on an Astro-Physics (AP) mount. <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/193302744@N07/53482036833/in/dateposted-public' target='_blank'>View high resolution</a>.">

                data-notes="IC 405 and IC 410 Nebulae.
The nebula in the center (leaning slightly to the left) is IC 405, famously known as the Flaming Star Nebula. Located in the constellation Auriga, it is illuminated by the variable star AE Aurigae, the bright star at the nebula's core. This object is a combination of an emission and reflection nebula. As a reminder, emission nebulae are formed by the ionization of hydrogen atoms by radiation from young, energetic stars, while reflection nebulae scatter and reflect the light from surrounding stars.
IC 405 is located approximately 1,500 light-years away from us and spans about 5 light-years across.
In the right corner, you can see the Tadpole Nebula (IC 410)—named after the two 'tadpole' structures visible within it. I have previously captured this nebula at a higher resolution using a different telescope and camera setup from my home using narrowband filters; you can view that version here: [Link to Flickr].
IC 410 is also an emission nebula, somewhat resembling the Rosette Nebula found in the constellation Monoceros. At its center lies the star cluster NGC 1893, also known as the 'Y' Cluster—see if you can spot the letter Y in the formation. IC 410 is located much further away, at about 12,000 light-years from Earth.
Technical Details: This image was captured using a dual-rig setup of two RedCat 51 telescopes, each equipped with an ASI2600 Mono camera. One side captured HA (Hydrogen-alpha) data, while the other side simultaneously captured RGB frames.
